    overviewDetail:
      'Malaria remains one of the most significant public health challenges in Nigeria and across sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is caused by Plasmodium parasites, with Plasmodium falciparum being the most dangerous species. When an infected mosquito bites a person, the parasites enter the bloodstream and travel to the liver, where they mature and multiply. After several days, the parasites re-enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells, leading to the characteristic symptoms of malaria. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent severe illness and death.',
